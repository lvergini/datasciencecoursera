## My Data Science Toolbox

As a future data scientist, I plan to rely on a set of essential tools and platforms that I was introduced to in this course. These will help me throughout my learning and future work in data science.

### Core Tools

- **R**: A powerful programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- **RStudio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes coding, plotting, and document generation more accessible.
- **R Markdown**: A tool for combining code, results, and narrative in a single, reproducible document.

### Version Control

- **Git**: A version control system that helps track changes in code and collaborate with others.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for sharing code, collaborating with others, and hosting repositories.

### Learning Platforms & Communication

- **Coursera**: A platform that offers structured learning in data science and other fields.
- **Slack** (or similar): A tool for team communication and collaboration.

### Supporting Tools

- **Terminal / Command Line**: Useful for running scripts, navigating directories, and interacting with Git.
- **Stack Overflow** and the **R community**: Helpful for troubleshooting and learning from others' experiences.
